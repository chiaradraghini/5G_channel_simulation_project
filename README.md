# 5G_channel_simulation_project
The focus of the project was the modeling of a 5G communication channel through ray tracing, between a base station in a fixed position and a simulated moving vehicle. The purpose was studying and analyzing its performance and features in this particular scenario. Matlab's 5G Toolbox was used to execute the work.
